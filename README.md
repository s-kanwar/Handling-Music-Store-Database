# Handling-Music-Store-Database
For this project, I used a prototype database of an imaginary music store that operates globally.
I used the data base to build queries that will help in analyzing the trend of the music genre across regions.
The queries that were used to analyze the database are uploaded as a text file.
I further used exel to create charts and graphs for the visualization of the analysis.
